    # Averages of numbers

    The accounts of the "Fat to Fit Club (FFC)" association are supervised by John as a volunteered accountant. 
    
    The association is funded through financial donations from generous benefactors. 
    
    John has a list of the first n donations: [14, 30, 5, 7, 9, 11, 15] 
    
    He wants to know how much the next benefactor should give to the association so that the average of the first n + 1 donations should reach an average of 30. 
    
    After doing the math he found 149. He thinks that he made a mistake. Could you help him?

    if dons = [14, 30, 5, 7, 9, 11, 15] then (forAverage dons 30) = 149

    The function forAverage should return the expected donation (rounded up to the next integer) that will permit to reach the average navg.

    Should the last donation be a non positive number (<= 0) John wants us to return None so that he clearly sees that his expectations are not great enough.
